<h1> Introduction </h1>
 <p> My name is Shane Stark. As of the beginning of this website site, I am a fourth-year Mechanical Engineering Student At the University of Alberta. I am creating this website as a function of students in any part of their journey junior high- Senior Undergraduate as I don't plan taking graduate studies as of the late. 
<br>
The courses will range from introductory algebra to high-level calculus/partial differential equations, Statics and Dynamics and finally, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics. 
<br>
The website's structure will follow: you will build as you go along. Math is the fundamental tool for understanding science effectively.
; 
If you don't understand the mathematical background, you will never fully understand physics. 
<br>
That said, anyone can learn math; it is a question of whether you will.

<h1> Introduction </h1>
 <p> My name is Shane Stark as of the beginning of this website site, I am a fourth year Mechanical Engineering Student At the University of Alberta. I am creating this website as a function of students in any part of their journey junior high- Senior Undergraduate as I don't plan taking graduate studies as of the late. 
<br>
The courses offered will range form basic algebra to high level calculus/partial differential equations, Statics and Dynamics and finally Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics. 
<br>
The structure of the website will go as follow will build as you go along. Starting with math, math is the fundmental tool to understand science effectively 
if you dont understand the mathmatical background you will never fully understand the physics. 
<br>
With that being said, I fully believe anyone can learn math, it is a question of will you or not

<p>
    When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
    \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]

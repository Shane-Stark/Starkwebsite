<h1> Introduction </h1>
 <p> My name is Shane Stark. As of the beginning of this website site, I am a fourth-year Mechanical Engineering Student At the University of Alberta. I am creating this website as a function of students in any part of their journey junior high- Senior Undergraduate as I don't plan taking graduate studies as of the late. 
<br>
The courses will range from introductory algebra to high-level calculus/partial differential equations, Statics and Dynamics and finally, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics. 
<br>
The website's structure will follow: you will build as you go along. Starting with math, math is the fundamental tool to understand science effectively 
if you don't understand the mathematical background, you will never fully understand physics. 
<br>
That said, anyone can learn math; it is a question of whether you or not.

        Measurement Problems 
</header>
<p>
    As a Canadian I much prefer to use metric to calculate areas and volumes,
    <br>
    however it is a skill to understand how to change the form metric and imperial.
    <br>
    you may be asking youreself, Shane why waste time to learn this??
    <br> 
    its a good question, some designing problems are much easier to do in imperial units than metric
    <br>
    Most thermo-fluid system design classes use imperial units over metric

    This is a very easy formula to derive, a triangle is really just half a Rectangle 
    \(Area = 1/2*base*height\)
